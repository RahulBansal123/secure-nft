<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Checking the legitimacy of users and checking sybil resistance are the most common issues when airdropping NFTs. Gitcoin Passport helps to verify the credentials of the user and to make sure they are only participating with a single identity.

If the user doesn't have credentials, they won't be able to receive NFTs, which will ensure fair play in the game.

Contracts are deployed at: [0x91606B3b2B0b06411e332D9428c234e1fFBFfB82](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x91606B3b2B0b06411e332D9428c234e1fFBFfB82)
